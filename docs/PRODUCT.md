# Content Platform Product Brief

## Problem
Marketing and builder teams are disconnected. They use multiple tools to draft posts and separately track calendars, which creates:
- Unclear status of content (drafted, reviewed, scheduled, shared).
- Lost context when handoffs happen across tools.
- Inefficient coordination and missed windows.

## Goal
Build a single tool where teams can:
- See every piece of content and its current stage.
- Know which items are scheduled and which are already shared.
- Coordinate handoffs without leaving the workflow.

## Target Users
- Marketing leads and managers.
- Builders/engineers who contribute technical updates.
- Social media / community managers who schedule and publish.

## Desired Outcomes
- Reduce time spent status-chasing.
- Improve on-time publishing.
- Increase visibility into what’s coming and who owns it.

## Core Use Cases
- Draft a post with shared context.
- Move content through clear stages.
- Schedule content into a calendar.
- Confirm what has been shared and when.
- See upcoming and past content at a glance.

## Content Lifecycle (Proposed)
1. `Idea`
2. `Draft`
3. `Review`
4. `Approved`
5. `Scheduled`
6. `Shared`
7. `Archived`

Each item always has:
- Owner
- Stage
- Target platform(s)
- Scheduled time (if any)
- Last updated timestamp

## Key Views
- **Board**: Kanban-style by stage for fast status scanning.
- **Calendar**: Week/Month view for scheduled and shared posts.
- **Timeline**: Feed-style list of upcoming and recent content.

## Collaboration & Workflow
- Assign ownership at each stage.
- Inline comments for handoff notes.
- Activity log for status changes.

## MVP Scope
- Single workspace.
- Content items with stages.
- Simple calendar scheduling.
- Manual status updates.
- Basic platform tagging (X, LinkedIn, etc.).

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- Auto-posting integrations.
- Analytics and performance dashboards.
- AI content generation.

## Metrics of Success
- Time from draft to scheduled (median).
- Percentage of content scheduled on time.
- Reduction in “status check” messages.

## Open Questions
- Which platforms are highest priority for scheduling?
- How strict do stage definitions need to be?
- What permissions/roles are required?
